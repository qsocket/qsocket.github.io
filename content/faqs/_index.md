# FAQs.

* **Q: Why did you create your own version instead of contributing to the gsocket project?**
    * Simple answer would be we didn't want to write C code `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` 
    * Also as explained in the projects Github repo, we want to take advantage of the Go/Rust compiler tool chain and target all possible platforms/architectures. At the end QSocket will be deployable to any device that is connected to internet.
